### Intelligent Agents

An intelligent agent interacts with the environment, perceiving its state with sensors and affects its state with actuators. They make decisions based on these factors. The loop in which this happens is called 'Perception-Action Cycle'


### Applications of AI

Finance: Trading agents that determine when to buy or sell assets

Robotics: robots that move and behave according to the environment

Games: characters that seem to think and better opponents

Medicine: systems that help diagnose patients according to symptoms

The Web: crawlers that collect information and infer page relevance


### Terminology

#### Environments

Fully observable
* view all cards is possible
* sensors can see the entire state of the environment

Partially observable
* view of some cards is possible
* sensors can see a fraction state of the environment, possibly memorizing them

--------------------------------------------------

Deterministic
* actions are predictable
* a given move of a chess piece will always result the same

Stochastic
* actions are not predictable
* rolling of dice will be different each time

--------------------------------------------------

Discrete
* possible actions are finite
* chess board

Continuous
* possible actions are infinite
* throw of dart

--------------------------------------------------

Benign
* stochastic environment with no intention to harm

Adversarial
* environment will try to harm/defeat

#### Quiz

The game of checkers is:
* Fully observable
* Deterministic
* Discrete
* Adversarial *

The game of poker is:
* Partially observable
* Stochastic
* Discrete
* Adversarial

Robotic car is:
* Partially observable
* Stochastic
* Continuous
* Benign


### AI and Uncertainty

* Uncertainty management
* What to do when you don't know what to do
* Reasons of uncertainty:
    * Sensor limits
    * Adversaries
    * Stochastic environments
    * Laziness
    * Ignorance


### Machine Translation

Translate form 50 languages to any of the 50 languages based on examples. Look for words in a given language and associate to words (or small sentences) in the other language (e.g. in a chinese restaurant menu, associate 'chicken', 'corn cream', and 'soup' with its characters in chinese).
